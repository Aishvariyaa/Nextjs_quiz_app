## How It Works

* The app cycles through a list of questions defined in `src/pages/index.js`.
* When the user selects an option, it checks if the answer is correct and updates the score.
* After the last question, it displays the total score out of the number of questions.
* The app uses React state hooks (`useState`) to manage the current question, score, and whether to show the final score.

## How to Extend This App

Here are some ideas to enhance your quiz app:

* Add a **Restart Quiz** button to allow users to retake the quiz.
* Add more questions or load questions dynamically from a JSON file or API.
* Style the app using **Tailwind CSS** or CSS modules for better visuals.
* Make it **multi-page** by adding a `/result` page with Next.js routing.
* Add timer functionality per question.
* Store high scores using localStorage or a backend.
* Add animations and transitions for better UX.
